# Simulation of elevators

**elevator.py** implements the elevator class, which executes actions based on commands given to it
**passenger.py** implements the passenger class. A passenger can send command to the elevator that he/she is in
**command_system.py** deals with logic of assigning elevators to requests. Has access to information of all elevators.
**simulation.py** creates the environment, controls passenger generator and runs the simulation

To run a sample program, edit the main function in simulation.py to set the parameters and run python simulation.py
